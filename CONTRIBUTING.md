## Making changes

### Editing an existing article

1. Find the relevant `.md` file under `pages/`.
2. Edit the content (standard GitHub-flavored Markdown).
3. Open a pull request — no build step required to review prose changes.

### Adding a new article

1. Choose the most relevant section directory, or propose a new one in your PR.
2. Create a new `.md` file with a descriptive kebab-case name.
3. Include frontmatter at the top of the file if required by `doc-kit`.

### Adding a new section

Open an issue first to discuss the proposed section before adding files.
Refer to the [Card Sort results](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/8234)
for prior user-research context on content organisation.
